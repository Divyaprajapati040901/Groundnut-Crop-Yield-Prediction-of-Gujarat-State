# Groundnut-Crop-Yield-Prediction-of-Gujarat-State
The groundnut crop yield prediction project for Gujarat State utilizes data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). Following preprocessing steps, a model is deployed for prediction. Finally, a dashboard is created to visualize and communicate the results effectively, facilitating informed decision-making in agricultural planning and management.


Acquiring Data via Google Earth Engine (GEE):

A great tool for getting access to a lot of geospatial data, including satellite photography, is Google Earth Engine. You most certainly gathered pertinent data for your study, including soil composition, meteorological data, satellite images, and perhaps socioeconomic variables that affect crop productivity. This is an important phase because it sets up your analysis and forecasts.


Data Preprocessing: 

To guarantee the quality of the data and its usefulness for analysis, preprocessing is necessary once it has been acquired. This process includes feature engineering, normalization, and data cleansing. It's possible that you have extracted pertinent data from satellite photos using image processing techniques, such as the vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, and LAI) which are essential markers of crop health and yield potential.


Model Development:

After obtaining preprocessed data, a predictive model must be created. For this, machine learning methods like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines might have been used. In order to discover patterns and correlations that allow them to forecast future crop yields, these models are trained using historical crop yield data in conjunction with the features that were collected.


Model Deployment: 

In order for the model to make predictions on fresh data, it must be deployed after it has been trained and verified. In order to obtain estimated crop yields, users can enter pertinent information such as location, weather, and soil type through the creation of an API (Application Programming Interface) or by integrating the model into a web application. The process of deployment guarantees that stakeholders, including farmers and agricultural officials, can access and utilize the model.


Dashboard Creation:

A dashboard is made to facilitate the easy comprehension and application of the model's insights. Maps, charts, and tables are probably used in this dashboard to show the anticipated crop production both spatially and chronologically. Users may be able to explore various locations or eras and comprehend the reasons impacting agricultural yield variability by utilizing interactive components. Furthermore, the dashboard might provide tools like notifications or alerts to notify users of noteworthy adjustments or trends in crop yield projections.
